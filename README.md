Go HMAC Validator
=================

A generic tiny Golang package to check HMAC signatures generated by Internet Services to guarantee the HTTP request origin.

## Documentation

Package is documented following [Golang conventions](http://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code) so you can generate them with [godoc command](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc) or read them online on [golang.org](https://godoc.org/github.com/ifraixedes/go-hmac-validator).

## Golang Version & dependencies

I started this implementation with Golang 1.6rc2 and I update to 1.6 when it was officially released.

The library should work with version 1.5 using the `GOVENDOREXPERIMENT=1` environment variable as this repo has vendorized the current dependencies, and the changes in 1.6 which affect to this implementation are to boost performance than deprecating or breaking anything; however I haven't tried to run the test on 1.5 or a previous version rewriting the imported package paths.

The current dependencies are only used in the tests, check `makefile` `deps` target and `vendor` folder to know which ones they are.

## Roadmap

- Write [Golang Examples](https://blog.golang.org/examples) for each of the providers as I've considered to implement this package [Shopify](https://docs.shopify.com/api/authentication/oauth), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/security) and [Pusher](https://pusher.com/docs/auth_signatures)

## Why

After I implemented this concept in a node module, I thought that would be great to have this generic HMAC validation functionality for Golang, so I took the concept and I developed it in the Go way (this is not a the NodeJS implementation translated to Go).

## Related works

The same concept and similar functionality for [NodeJS](https://github.com/ifraixedes/node-hmac-validator)
