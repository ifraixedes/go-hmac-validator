Go HMAC Validator
=================

A generic tiny Golang package to check HMAC signatures generated by Internet Services to guarantee the HTTP request origin.

## Usage


## Documentation

Package is documented following [Golang conventions](http://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code) so you can generate them with [godoc command](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc) or read them online on [godoc.org](https://godoc.org/go.fraixed.es/hmacval).


The package is served under a custom domain and a canonical import path is set in order to restrict to import this package through the _github.com_ domain, hence for getting it you have to 

`go get go.fraixed.es/hmacval`

## Golang Version & dependencies

The library may work with a few previous Golang releases, however I haven't tested in any than 1.6.

The current dependencies are only used in the tests, which are [testify](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify) [assert](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert) and [require](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/require)

## Roadmap

Write some benchmarks and do an implementation of using key/value byte slice as payload than a map to compare how map type probably penalize and it may be avoided.

## Why

After I implemented this concept in a node module, I thought that would be great to have this generic HMAC validation functionality for Golang, so I took the concept and I developed it in the Go way (this is not a the NodeJS implementation translated to Go).

## Related works

The same concept and similar functionality for [NodeJS](https://github.com/ifraixedes/node-hmac-validator)
